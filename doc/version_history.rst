Version History
###############

v1.11.1
-------

* `ATDomeCsc`:

    * Remove the ``mock_port`` constructor argument; always use 0 (pick a free port).
    * In simulation mode do not start the mock controller server a second time.
    * Use lsst.ts.tcpip.Client instead of a bare reader and writer to talk to the low-level controller.
    * When logging an exception: include the exception text in the main message.
      This duplicates information but makes it easier to find the information.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 7
* ts_simactuators 2

* ts_idl
* ts_tcpip 1.1
* IDL file for ATDome built from ts_xml 11

v1.10.1
-------

* `ATDomeCsc`: work around a bug in the low-level controller's home command by not homing if sitting on the homed switch and already homing.
  We do not yet know what the low-level controller's home command does if the dome is sitting on the homed switch and the dome is not yet homed; so don't do anything special with that case.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3

* Updated for new low-level controller software that reports whether the dome is homed.
* Modernized the unit tests to use bare assert.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3

* `DomeCsc`: overhaul azimuth homing:

    * Output new azimuthState event fields ``homed`` and ``homeSwitch``.
      This requires ts_xml 9.
    * Make the ``homeAzimuth`` command report wait until homing is finished,
      and provide an CMD_INPROGRESS acknowledgement with a pessimistic time estimate when it starts.
    * Make ``moveAzimuth`` and ``homeAzimuth`` fail while homing.
    * Log a warning if you call ``moveAzimuth`` when the dome is not homed
      (as far as the CSC knows; this information is not yet available from the low-level controller).

  and add links to the ts_xml documentation for all commands and events mentioned in the guide.

* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 8

* `ATDomeCsc`: make the ``standby`` command more reliable by eliminating a race condition that could cause a fault.
* `MoveCode`: make this a public class and update `MockDomeController` to use it.
* `MockDomeController`: change the initial azimuth and specify it in a new constant ``INITIAL_AZIMUTH``.
* Fixed a race condition in test_stop in test_csc.py.
* Update doc/conf.py for documenteer 0.6.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2

* Add intersphinx mapping to ts_salobj and ts_xml to the documentation.
* Use ``pre-commit`` instead of a custom git pre-commit hook.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

v1.2.1
------

Changes:

* Overhaul the documentation.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

v1.2.0
------

Changes:

* Updated for ts_simactuators 2
* Removed all use of astropy Angle.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15
* ts_simactuators 2

v1.1.3
------

Changes:

* Remove ``sudo: false`` from ``.travis.yml``.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.11
* ts_simactuators 0.1
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

v1.1.2
------

Changes:

* Add a test that the code is formatted with ``black``.
  This test uses a function that was added to ts_salobj 5.11.
* Use mock_port=0 with the `ATDomeCsc` and port=0 with the `MockDomeController` constructor to mean "pick an available port".
  This eliminates the risk that a unit test can fail due to trying to use a TCP/IP port that is already in use.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.11
* ts_simactuators 0.1
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

v1.1.1
------

Major changes:

* Fix determination of "azimuth in position" by using a tolerance a bit larger than that used by the low-level controller.
  This margin is controlled by attribute `az_tolerance_margin`.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.4
* ts_simactuators 0.1
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

v1.1.0
------

Major changes:

* Output additional information, as new fields in the ``settingsAppliedController`` event and ``position`` telemetry, plus new events ``doorEncoderExtremes`` and ``lastAzimuthGoTo``.
  This requires ts_xml 4.8.
* Improve error handling by rejecting commands if the low level controller returns unexpected data.
* Rewrite test_csc to use `lsst.ts.salobj.BaseCscTestCase`.
  This requires ts_salobj 5.4.
* Code formatted by ``black``, with a pre-commit hook to enforce this. See the README file for configuration instructions.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.4
* ts_simactuators 0.1
* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.8

* ts_idl
* IDL file for ATDome from ts_xml 4.1

v0.8.0
------
